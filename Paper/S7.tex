\section{Conclusion}
%summary and reiterate hypothesis and if it was satisfied
Although we could not proof our hypothesis due to lack of experiment with participant, we completed the components that adds complexity to existing kinesthetic guidance. In this paper, we implemented two kinesthetic guidance methods, continuous and on-demand kinesthetic guidance and explained motion planner for both methods. We believe these methods will contributes towards future experiment. In the future, we can also explore preference between audio guidance and on-demand guidance to promote independence for people with visually impairment.
