\begin{abstract}
Kinesthetic guidance for the visually impaired is a highly relevant research area in human robot interaction. We proposed two methods of kinesthetic guidance, continuous and on-demand. Continuous kinesthetic guidance will guide a person through obstacles from start to end goal by having the person hold on robot arm while on-demand will allow person to navigate to end-goal freely and give feedback when they enter the obstacle region. We are using a Sawyer arm as our guiding agent and setting up our experiment in a Gazebo simulation environment. We are measuring our result by the time it took to get from start to end-goal and the number of collisions for both methods. Our experiment introduces complexity by adding a human arm in the path planning algorithm for an environment with obstacles.
